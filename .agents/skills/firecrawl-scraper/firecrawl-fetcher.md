# Firecrawl Fetcher Sub-skill

> Note: This is an internal sub-skill, invoked by the `firecrawl-scraper` main skill through the Task tool.

## Purpose

Execute Firecrawl API calls in an independent context with `context: fork`, avoiding carrying main conversation context, reducing token consumption.

## Received Parameters

Receives complete command through Task's `prompt`, using stdin for JSON:

```bash
cat <<'JSON' | node .claude/skills/firecrawl-scraper/firecrawl-api.js <scrape|crawl|map|batch-scrape|crawl-status> [--wait]
{ ...payload... }
JSON
```

## Output

Returns Firecrawl API's JSON response as-is (pretty printed).
